Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have Lorem Lorem evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will 
give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
 Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
 which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
 to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
that produces no resultant pleasure?"
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to 
ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when 
our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is 
to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
 always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, 
or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
