The time is now, on everything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

[Hook: Wale]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

[Hook]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Verse 3: Wale]
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit, I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything, and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

[Outro: Wale]
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
