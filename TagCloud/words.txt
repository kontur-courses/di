my
younger
and
more
vulnerable
years
my
father
gave
me
some
advice
that
I
ve
been
turning
over
in
my
mind
ever
since
Whenever
you
feel
like
criticizing
any
one
he
told
me
just
remember
that
all
the
people
in
this
world
haven
t
had
the
advantages
that
you
ve
had
He
didn
t
say
any
more
but
we
ve
always
been
unusually
communicative
in
a
reserved
way
and
I
understood
that
he
meant
a

and
so
it
came
about
that
in
college
I
was
unjustly
accused
of
being
a
politician
because
I
was
privy
to
the
secret
griefs
of
wild
unknown
men
Most
of
the
confidences
were
unsought
frequently
I
have
feigned
sleep
preoccupation
or
a
hostile
levity
when
I
realized
by
some
unmistakable
sign
that
an
intimate
revelation
was
quivering
on
the
horizon
for
the
intimate
revelations
of
young
men
