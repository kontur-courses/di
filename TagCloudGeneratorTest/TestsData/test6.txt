Yeah
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now
But
hey
what
daddy
always
tell
you
Straighten
up
little
soldier
Stiffen
up
that
upper
lip
What
you
crying
about
You
got
me
Hailie
I
know
you
miss
mom
and
I
know
you
miss
dad
Well
I'm
gone
but
I'm
trying
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
you
are
sad
even
when
you
smile
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
eyes
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
Cuz
you
are
scared
I
ain't
there
Daddy's
with
you
in
prayers
No
more
crying
wipe
them
tears
Daddy's
here
no
more
nightmares
We
gon'
pull
together
through
it
we
gon'
do
it
Laney
uncles
crazy
aint
he
Yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
We're
all
we
got
in
this
world
When
it
spins
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls
when
it
twirls
Two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin'
puzzled
in
a
daze
I
know
it's
confusing
you
Daddy's
always
on
the
move
mamma's
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growing
up
his
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
don't
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way
mother
and
me
But
things
have
gotten
so
bad
between
us
I
don't 
see
us
ever
being
together
ever 
again
Like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
But
it's
just
something
we
have
no
control
over 
and 
that's
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries
rest
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
haha
